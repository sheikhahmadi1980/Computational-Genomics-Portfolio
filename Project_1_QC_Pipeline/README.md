# Computational Genomics Portfolio - Mohammad Sheikhahmadi

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This repository showcases my projects and skills in computational genomics, bioinformatics, and their application in animal breeding. Each project is organized into its own directory and includes a dedicated `README.md` file explaining its objectives, methods, and outcomes.
